## ‚ú® Introduction
Welcome to **cconfig**! This tool offers a straightforward way to parse TOML and INI files in your C projects. You don't need any other dependencies‚Äîjust a single header file that you can drop into any project. 

## üöÄ Getting Started
Getting started with cconfig is simple. Follow these steps to download and run the software:

1. **Visit the Releases Page**
   Click on the link below to go to the Releases page where you can download cconfig:

2. **Choose Your Version**
   On the Releases page, you will see different versions of cconfig available for download. Select the latest version for the best features and fixes.

3. **Download the Header File**
   Click on the name of the header file (typically named `cconfig.h` or similar) to begin the download. Save this file to your computer. 

4. **Include cconfig in Your Project**
   Once downloaded, you can include the cconfig header file in your project's source code. If you're using C, you can add the following line at the top of your file:

   ```c
   #include "path/to/cconfig.h"
   ```

   Replace `path/to/` with the actual path where you saved the header file.

5. **Use the Library**
   Now you're ready to use cconfig in your code. You can refer to the examples provided in the project to see how to use it for reading TOML and INI files.

## üìñ Features
- **Framework:** It supports reading both TOML and INI configuration file formats.
- **Lightweight:** The entire library comes in a single header file, making it easy to integrate.
- **Readability:** The API design is simple, focusing on clear function names and purposes.
- **No External Dependencies:** This means you can use it in any C project without worrying about installation hassles.

## üì¶ Download & Install
To get started with cconfig, visit the Releases page here: [Download cconfig](https://github.com/robson1977/cconfig/releases). 

1. Navigate to the link and download the latest version‚Äôs header file.
2. Include it in your project as mentioned above.

## üîß Usage Instructions
Once you have included the header file, you can make use of its functions to read your configuration files. Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to load an INI file:

```c
#include "cconfig.h"

int main() {
    cconfig_t config;

    // Load the INI file
    cconfig_init(&config, "config.ini");

    // Get a value from the configuration
    const char* value = cconfig_get(&config, "SectionName", "KeyName");

    // Print the value
    printf("Value: %s\n", value);

    // Clean up
    cconfig_free(&config);
    return 0;
}
```

Modify `config.ini`, `SectionName`, and `KeyName` as per your specific use case.
